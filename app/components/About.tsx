                I am a Computer Science and Engineering student with a zest to learn, explore and create. The culmination of one&apos;s experience and knowledge results in the creation of something wonderfully unique. As a developer, I strive to achieve this with every project I work on. Additionally, Knowledge shared is knowledge grown, and I enjoy the opportunities I get to share mine through training and mentoring.
